# Summer_Intern_Bio_Reactor

Summer project under the guidence of Dr. Harshwardhan Katkar from April'24 to Present.
The project aims to acquire real-time data around 300 C temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH from a solution and investigate their dependencies. We utilized the following sensors: PT1000 for temperature, ENV-50-DO for DO, and HI-1006-3205 for pH, interfacing them with microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi Pico or Arduino Uno. Data acquisition is achieved by detecting the analog signals, converting them to digital signals, followed by calibration using standard values, trends, and voltage gradients.
